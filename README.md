# feedback

[This repo][] is a collection of technology (software mostly) that was/is
generated as a byproduct of the development of an improvised musical
performance piece currently titled "feedback" by the [CREATE Ensemble][]. In
this piece, each player performs with an instrument that processes an input
signal which is a mix of other players output signals such that feedback is
inevitable. So far, the topology of the signal digraph is a single ring--Each
player processes the input of her immediate right (or left) neighbor. However,
many different topologies are possible (and possibly interesting) and the one
goal of the piece is to explore changing digraph topologies during the
performance.

## DONE

- This repo and this write-up
- Example instruments in Max/MSP, Puredata, and Arduino
- Matrix mixer to replace hardware/analog mixer and facilitate visualizations

## TODO

- Test matrix mixer in rehersal/performance
- Implement internal multitap delay feedback example instrument
- Implement embedded instrument (Raspberry Pi, Teensy3, iPad)
- Create visualization of piece, including graph topolgy, spectrums, levels,
  waveforms, delay time, internal feedback parameters, etc
- Explore new topologies and topology transitions in rehersal and performance
- Research methods for assessing stability and predicting attractors

## Instrument Design and Typical Characteristics

As the nature of the piece has evolved so has the description of the typical
(or desirable) instrument. Each instrument in the piece is a node in a digraph,
so in order to allow feedback, each instrument must provide a few basic
affordances and each digraph must contain at least one cycle. Each node must
provide some sort of attenuation/amplification and some perceptually
substantial delay. Ideally (optionally), an instrument (or the system) shows
the player the input level and the output level of her node, but the input
spectrum and the output spectrum may be more useful visual feeback.

For the piece to remain viable, some characteristics are necessary for the
system and some characteristics are necessary for each individual node
(instrument). When the topology is a simple, single ring, at least one
instrument needs to exhibit a long delay (perceptually substantial) so that the
feedback system does not suffer from unwieldy "ringing". More generally, any
instrument that is participant in a ring (aka digraph cycle) should exhibit a
long delay. For this reason, ideally each instrument has controllable delay
time.

The system may be thought of as a [Feedback Delay Network][].

Each instrument may exhibit internal feedback.
