# Diagrams

Here are some diagrams to be built with GraphViz that illustrate some different
possible topologies for the feedback system.

## Building

To look at the graphs, you first need to install GraphViz, then run this
command on the terminal in this directory.

    make

That will generate a number of .svg files.

## Dependencies

If you use homebrew on osx, you already have make, so you just need to install
GraphViz with this command:

    brew install graphviz
